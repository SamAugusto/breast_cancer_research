Confirm what we found that tumor size increase does increase the chance of a tumor being malign. So this is a big factor for diagnosis and predictions.


Duke website and other random websites claim that is false or not entire true however as of today I cannot find any source to the studies they claimed they performed.

Accredited journals such as Nature and the New England Journal of Medicine have no studies talking about tumor size and malignity from what I found
I searched for "Tumor Sized and Malignity" on both journals  and I have yet to find any studies reporting on it.
